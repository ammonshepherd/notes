## Why learn Ruby

First of all, the job requires it. And I'm glad, I want to learn more programming languages.

Second, the first project I get is built in ruby, the Geoloader script, and it's a good idea to know the language it is written in. That way I can fix it if it gets broken or needs more functionality.

## Where to learn Ruby

There is a site that lists a bunch of other sites to learn Ruby: [http://iwanttolearnruby.com](http://iwanttolearnruby.com)

I went with the Ruby tutorials at [http://codecademy.com](http://codecademy.com).
