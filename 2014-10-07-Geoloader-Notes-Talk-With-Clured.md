# Geoloader needs...

to not use Geonetwork and geoserver, but since they are used, they are needed...

- Geoportal needs to be up and running: [https://github.com/scholarslab/geoportal](https://github.com/scholarslab/geoportal)

- Geonetwork doesn't need to show the thumbnails of the uploaded tif, because it points to or pulls it in from the associated geoserver record.
