This site fulfills two purposes:

1. Help me learn Jekyll
2. Serve as daily, weekly, notebook to keep thoughts on the work that I'm doing. I'll keep notes on the tasks I'm working on each day, and jot down any issues I come across and the solution when I figure it out.


Keeping this default text here, just in case I need the links later:

This is based on the default, base Jekyll theme. You can find out more info about customizing your Jekyll theme, as well as basic Jekyll usage documentation at [jekyllrb.com](http://jekyllrb.com/)

You can find the source code for the Jekyll new theme at: [github.com/jglovier/jekyll-new](https://github.com/jglovier/jekyll-new)
