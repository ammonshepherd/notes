# Baby, it's cold inside.

Recently our office has been cold! Initially it was an issue with the cooling
system elsewhere in the building. The problem has returned. While the
temperatures outside are rising, the temperatures inside are falling. At it's
coldest, I recorded a temperature of 58 degrees F.

I devised a way to record the temperature using the TMP36 temperature sensor for
Arduino. While commiserating with fellow office mates, we got the idea to email
facilities every N minutes to let them know how cold we are. So I figured out
how to do that.

# Set up the arduino

First, you'll need an Arduino kit. We have these from Sparkfun: https://www.sparkfun.com/products/13154

Set up the Arduino like so: https://github.com/rwaldron/johnny-five/blob/master/docs/temperature-tmp36.md

# Install some software

You'll need the Arduino software
