# Role of Libraries in Geo-Humanities

## Five roles/goals? of Libraries

## Nicole Kong, Purdue University Library
Barriers
  - technology, learning curve
  - data - messy
  - systems - they use Macs, want to share on web

Library can address the barriers
  - learning support
  - data services GIS cyberinfrastructure support
  - lab and server space

Learning Support
  - Help humanities scholars know what type of projects they can do.
  - Bring together different fields and help each other learn what data and
    knowledge they can provide.

Data collection Stage
  - support in collecting data and ways to collect data
  - mobile based field data collection (get the data from device to database)

Data Visualization Stage

Data Analysis Stage (learning)
  - workshops
  - embeded teaching
  - credit courses
  - online learning

GIS Day - Spatial Humanities focused presentations (publications with exposure
through Google Scholar)


## Kelsey Rydland and Ann Aler, Northwestern University Library

http://sites.northwestern.edu/nudhl/

- tools
  - High res scanner
  - ArcGIS online
  - CartoDB
  - Omeka/Neatline
- Monthly meetings with departments to discuss methods
- Enterprise Investment (CartoDB, ArcGIS)
- Digital Humanities Working Group (Librarian)

## Kevin Dyke and Ryan Mattke, University of Minnesota Libraries

DAH - Digital Arts Sciences + Humanities

U-Spatial. support for spatial research at UofM, outside of the Library. 6+ RA's
from Geography department that consult with researchers.

MHAPO - Google API and XML based. Now is ESRI

## Kathryn Lage, University of Colorado Boulder
Research Data Curration

Data behind the projects. Reuse of that data

Hard to find examples of how geo-data is currated.

DH curration guide: http://guide.dhcuration.org/

Research Activities:
- creating: libraries role in supporting falls under data services (workshops,
  software licenses, guides to resources, figuring out where people can get
  help-putting people and resources together)
- capturing: offer help finding funding agencies, DMPTool (https://dmptool.org/)
- storage: individual, repositories, geoportals, data mega-portals
- describing: documentation and metadata, provide metadata
- preserving: storage and geographic location, file fixity and data integrity,
  information security, metadata, file formats
  (http://www.digitalpreservation.gov/formats/)
- sharing: different levels-individual/project-based/research group solution,
  publisher-based, repositories (institutional, discipline-based, national),
  geoportals (OpenGeoPortal, Share Geo Open https://www.sharegeo.ac.uk/), research data portals (http://www.re3data.org/, http://dataverse.org/, http://opengeoportal.org/)
  - citing: no recognition for depositing data sets. humanities scholars are
    citing reports about geo data, but not the data sets themselves. Library
    needs to teach how to cite geo data.

Curration of the data as important as the presentation.
