Creating a box from a set up vagrant machine:

CREATE A NEW VM FROM THE NEW BOX FILE (LONG METHOD)
If you want to add the box to your vagrant box list (to use the box by itâ€™s name, not by giving the file location) do it like this:

vagrant package
Add the box to Virtualbox (chose a box name for name-of-this-box):

vagrant box add name-of-this-box package.box virtualbox
Now you can create virtual machines from this box by simply giving the name of the box in the Vagrantfile, like

config.vm.box = "name-of-my-box"
A config.vm.box_url is not necessary anymore.
