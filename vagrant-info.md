# Create box from vagrant machine

Creating a box from a set up vagrant machine:

http://www.dev-metal.com/copy-duplicate-vagrant-box/


CREATE A NEW VM FROM THE NEW BOX FILE (LONG METHOD)
If you want to add the box to your vagrant box list (to use the box by itâ€™s name, not by giving the file location) do it like this:

    vagrant package

Add the box to Virtualbox (chose a box name for name-of-this-box):

    vagrant box add name-of-this-box package.box

Now you can create virtual machines from this box by simply giving the name of the box in the Vagrantfile, like

    config.vm.box = "name-of-this-box"

A config.vm.box_url is not necessary anymore.


# SSH errors

```
The following SSH command responded with a non-zero exit status.
Vagrant assumes that this means the command failed!

/sbin/ifup eth1 2> /dev/null
```


    /etc/udev/rules.d/70-persistent-net.rules
